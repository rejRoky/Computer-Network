### Computer Network
------------------------

###  Components Of Computer Network
1. NIC(National interface card)
2. Hub
3. Switches
4. Cables and connectors
5. Router
6. Modem


#### NIC(National interface card)
***Helps the computer to communicate with another device.***
##### Two types of NIC 
1. Wireless NIC (radio wave technology)
2. Wired NIC (Cables use)

#### Hub
*Hub is a central device that splits the network connection into multiple devices*

#### Switches
*Switch is a networking device that groups all the devices over the network to transfer the data to another device*

#### Cables and connectors (three types of cables)
1. Twisted pair cable - *High-speed cable that transmits the data over 1Gbps or more*
2. Coaxial cable - *TV installation cable*
3. Fibre optic cable - *High-speed cable that transmits the data using light beams (expensive,government level)*

#### Router
*Router is a device that connects the LAN to the internet. The router is mainly used to connect the distinct networks or connect the internet to multiple computers.*

#### Modem
*Modem connects the computer to the internet over the existing telephone line or Mobile Operator*


### Uses Of Computer Network
1. Resource sharing
2. Server-Client model - *(Sever store the information and Clients access it remotely)*
3. Communication medium 
4. E-commerce


### Features Of Computer network
1. Communication speed
2. File sharing
3. Back up and Roll back is easy
4. Software and Hardware sharing
5. Security
6. Scalability
7. Reliability


### Computer Network Architecture (Two Types)
1. Peer-To-Peer network
2. Client/Server network


### Computer Network Types (Four Types)
1. LAN(Local Area Network)
2. PAN(Personal Area Network)
3. MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)
4. WAN(Wide Area Network)


### Network Topology
1. Bus - *All Devices are connected in single backbone cable. (CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)*
2. Ring - *Token passing*
3. Star - *Use a hub, and all deviecs are conected with hub*
4. Tree - *Bus and Star both*
5. Mesh - *Multiple paths from one computer to another computer*
6. Hybrid - *Two or more different topologies are combined together*



### Transmission modes (three categories)
1. Simplex mode - *Communication is unidirectional. A device can only send the data but cannot receive it*
2. Half-duplex mode - *Messages flow in both the directions but not simultaneously*
3. Full-duplex mode - *Simultaneously*

### Computer Network Models
1. Layered Architecture
2. OSI Model
3. TCP/IP model

#### Layered Architecture
1. Service
2. Protocol
3. Interface

#### OSI Model
***PDNTSPA***
1. Physical Layer
2. Data-Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer


#### TCP/IP model
1. Application layer 
2. Transport layer 
3. Network layer 
3. Data link layer 
4. Physical layer
